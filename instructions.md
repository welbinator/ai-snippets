1: General Idea
"I want a WordPress plugin that lets me create little bits of code—called 'snippets'—using AI. I should be able to write a short description of what I want the code to do, and then the AI will create the code for me. The plugin will save these snippets in a list that I can manage from the WordPress admin area."

2: Plugin Functionality
"When I install the plugin, there should be a page in my WordPress admin area called 'Snippets.'"
"On that page, I should see a list of all the snippets I’ve created, with the ability to turn each one on or off. I should also be able to edit or delete them."
"There should be a button or a form to 'Create New Snippet.'"
"When I click it, a box should pop up where I can describe what I want. For example, I might type, 'Create a shortcode that shows today's weather.'"
"The AI should read my description and generate a piece of code that I can save as a snippet."

3: Safe Mode
"If I turn on a snippet and it breaks my site, I need a way to fix it. Maybe the plugin can have a 'Safe Mode' button in the settings. When I turn it on, all snippets are disabled, so I can log back into my site without problems."

4: AI Integration
"I have an OpenAI API key. There should be a place in the plugin settings where I can enter it."
"The plugin should use this key to talk to OpenAI when creating snippets."
"If my API key is invalid, the plugin should tell me and not try to generate code."

5: Real-Time Interaction
"When I’m typing my description of what I want, it would be nice if the plugin gives me suggestions or feedback—like, 'Your description is too vague' or 'Can you be more specific about what the snippet should do?'"
"After I submit my description, I don’t want to wait too long. If it’s taking a while, maybe show a loading animation or message."

6: How Snippets Work
"Once a snippet is created, I should be able to copy it or enable it directly from the plugin."
"If I enable a snippet, it should automatically work on my website."
"For example, if the snippet is a shortcode, I should be able to paste it into a page or post, and it should do whatever it’s supposed to do."

7: Error Handling
"If something goes wrong—like the snippet doesn’t work or the AI can’t understand my request—I want the plugin to show me a friendly error message explaining what happened."
"I also want the plugin to tell me if there are issues with the snippets I’ve already created, like if they conflict with something else on my site."

8: Design and Simplicity
"The plugin should be really easy to use. No complicated menus or settings. Everything should be clear and labeled."
"I want the admin pages to look clean and match the WordPress design so it feels like part of the site."

9: Security
"Make sure the plugin is secure. I don’t want anyone who isn’t an admin messing with my snippets or accessing my OpenAI API key."
"The plugin should validate everything I type to make sure it’s safe and won’t break my site."

10: Optional Extras
"If possible, I’d love to have a way to preview what the snippet will do before I save it."
"It would also be cool if the plugin can suggest improvements for snippets I already have."

Notes:

You are already in the root directory of the plugin, so you don't need to create wp-content or a plugins folder, you can just create the files in the root directory like the main plugin file and other plugin files/folders.
